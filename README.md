# Lazy TV

I got fed up with my Playstation 4 because of its frustrating UI. I wanted to use it for viewing TV shows with Plex, browsing YouTube videos and playing some games with friends (co-op). However, for starting Plex or YouTube I had to hit like 8+ buttons to start the app. You can't even pin the app to the main menu.

I replaced the PS4 with a HTPC connected to my TV. Using keyboard and mouse to navigate in Windows is painful when sitting on the couch. Then I found Steam Big Picture mode. It kinda replicates the PS4 UI, but somewhat better. I still found I had to navigate way too much. Furthermore, using Plex and YouTube was even more of a pain than with PS4.

**So I built my own big picture mode.**
